# 📝 To-Do List App

A simple and responsive To-Do List web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project stores tasks in the browser's **Local Storage**, allowing users to manage their daily tasks without losing data on refresh or close.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Add new tasks
- 🗑️ Delete tasks
- ✏️ Mark tasks as completed
- 💾 Persistent storage using Local Storage
- 📱 Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## 🧠 What I Learned

While building this project, I explored:

- **HTML**: Structuring the app with semantic elements like `<input>`, `<button>`, and `<ul>`
- **CSS**: Styling the layout, adding hover effects, and making it responsive
- **JavaScript**:
  - DOM manipulation (`document.querySelector`, `addEventListener`)
  - Event handling for user interactions
  - Using `localStorage.setItem()` and `localStorage.getItem()` to persist data
  - Array methods like `push()`, `filter()`, and `forEach()`

## 📦 How It Works

1. User enters a task and clicks "Add"
2. Task is added to the list and saved in Local Storage
3. On page reload, tasks are loaded from Local Storage
4. User can mark tasks as done or delete them
